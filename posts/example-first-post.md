# Hello World

This is an example post to demonstrate the blog system. When you're ready to publish your first real post, you can delete this file and create your own.

## How to Create Posts

1. Copy `posts/template.md` to a new file
2. Update the frontmatter (the section between `---`)
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Run `npm run build` to generate the HTML
5. Commit and deploy!

## What's Next

I'll be writing about:

- Building AI systems for investment research
- Lessons from quantitative trading
- Thoughts on markets and technology
- The journey of building Darwin Investment Systems

Stay tuned!
